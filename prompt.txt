I need you to process PDF files containing MCQ exam questions and convert them into structured JSON format.

**TASK OVERVIEW:**
Read PDF files that contain multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Hindi, English, or both languages. The PDFs may include:
- Regular MCQ questions with 4-5 options (A, B, C, D, E)
- Questions with images
- Match the following type questions (List 1 to List 2)
- Questions with tables or other formats
- The last page contains correct answers with question numbers

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Generate a JSON array where each question follows this structure:

**For Regular MCQ Questions:**
