So much for Day One of Couch to 5K training. I stayed right on that couch. So far I’ve unfollowed Buzzfeed Tasty, TasteMade (even their adorable Tiny Kitchen) and several people who have the enviable advantage of being able to eat as much as they want and not put on weight. By my calculations, dark chocolate is healthy. So I’m still following Earth Loaf, Pascati and Mason & Co.\n\nWhen I finally found a gym I liked with the best trainers I have had, I unabashedly shared my workouts every day. From shying away from full-length pictures, I reached a point where I could share videos of myself deadlifting and doing back squats with a barbell across my shoulders.
